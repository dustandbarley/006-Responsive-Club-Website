                    and a desire to help their community.

                    Since we started in 2008, well over 2000 bikes have been earned through the Project in this way.

                <p>Our Intensive Cycle Maintenance Course is over two Saturdays, 
                    tailored around your bike. Day 1 covers the most common 
                    repairs whilst Day 2 gets into the deeper workings of the 
                    bike. You can book both days or just one day if you prefer. 
                    No prior experience is needed &ndash; just the desire to get 
                    hands-on and skilled up! Each day has two tutors and is 
                    capped to six students, to ensure we can give you all the 
                    help you need in a relaxed and supportive environment.

                <p>Raise the Saddle happens every Monday 6-9pm so come and 
                    join us for some do it together fixing! 
                    The aim of Raise the saddle is to create a space for women, 
                    non binary and trans folk to learn, fix, teach, 
                    socialise and help each other. We believe that it is 
                    important to create this dedicated space, as well as 
                    encouraging folk to participate in the wider BBP community.

                <p>The workshop is coordinated by an experienced mechanic, 
                    but please be aware that this is a skill-sharing session, 
                    and our volunteers are not necessarily experts. 
                    Volunteers will be on hand to help you mend your bike, 
                    teaching you how to check your bike over, 
                    which tools to use and how to fix problems. 
                    We have a selection of bike maintenance books and resources, 
                    as well as internet tutorials, which you are welcome to use 
                    and we can guide you through what to search for or refer to. 
                    We also have wide range of new and used parts available to buy.

                <p>An event, community group, school or company hires a Dr Bike for a 
                    four hour session. The mechanic will arrive by bike, towing a 
                    trailer with tools, a stand and basic spares. The service is 
                    then free to those who attend, including free brake blocks and 
                    cables where needed. Each participant is treated to a safety 
                    check, and a gear and brake tune up. They are then presented w
                    ith a form giving a diagnosis of the health of their bike.

                <p>If a bike needs more work than is possible outside of a

                    Booking a Dr Bike is a great way to show your commitment

                    neighbours and we may not be able to repurpose them which means we will
                    have to use our time and resources to dispose of them. If you think your

                <p>If we can&apos;t salvage your bicycle, we will always strip them for any

                    damaged or otherwise unusable parts will be passed on to one of our 
                    partner organisations for reuse, upcycling or recycling.

                    now welcome some of the city&apos;s most marginalised and underprivileged 
                    folks to come and fix up bicycles with us to then take away.
